Important work items for Ed448-Goldilocks / decaf:

* Signed 32-bit NEON implementation to avoid bias/reduce after subtract

* Documentation: write high-level API docs, and internal docs to help
  other implementors.
    * Pretty good progress on Doxygenating the code.

* Documentation: write a spec or add to Watson's

* Cleanup: rename everything consistently.
    * namespace_op or op_namespace?  namespace_op_type?
    * We don't have to be super-careful with the namespacing, because
      symbols will be scrubbed by visibility
    * Mostly done.

* Cleanup: unify intrinsics code
    * Word_t, mask_t, bigregister_t, etc.
        * [ MOSTLY DONE ]
    * Generate asm intrinsics with a script?

* Testing:
    * More testing.  Testing, testing and testing.
    * Test corner cases better.

* Safety:
    * Decide what to do about RNG failures
        * abort
        * return error and zeroize [ THIS ]
        * return error but continue if RNG is kind of mostly OK

* Portability: test and make clean with other compilers
    * Using a fair amount of __attribute__ code.
    * [Should work for GCC now.  But not really on ARM.

* Portability: try to make the vector code as portable as possible
    * Currently using clang ext_vector_length.
    * I can't get a simple for-loop to autovectorize :-/
    * SAGE tool?

* Portability: make the outer layers of the code 32-bit clean.
    * Was [DONE], but a regression on ARM GCC.

* Performance: Improve SHAKE.
    * Improve speed.  (Maybe)

* Clear other TODO/FIXME/HACK/PERF items in the code

* More curves?  E-521 at least?  Ed41417?

* CFRG compat modes.

* Submit Decaf to SUPERCOP
